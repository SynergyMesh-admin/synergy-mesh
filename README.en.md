## 🚀 Getting Started

### Autonomous System Quick Start

The autonomous system framework provides complete support for drone and self-driving vehicle development:

```bash
# Navigate to autonomous system
cd automation/autonomous

# See detailed quickstart guide
cat docs-examples/QUICKSTART.md

# Install dependencies (Ubuntu 20.04+, Python 3.8+, ROS 2, Go 1.20+)
# Refer to the detailed guide for complete installation steps
```

See [Autonomous System Documentation](automation/autonomous/README.md) for complete setup instructions.

### Intelligent Automation Quick Start

```bash
# Install Python dependencies for intelligent automation
cd automation/intelligent
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run example
python pipeline_service.py
```

See individual service README files for specific setup instructions, including [Intelligent Automation Module](automation/intelligent/README.md).

## 🤖 Auto Review & Merge

This repository includes an automated review and merge workflow that:

1. **Automatically reviews** all Pull Requests
2. **Analyzes code** for potential issues like imports and formatting
3. **Auto-merges** approved PRs to the main branch

For detailed information, see [Auto Review & Merge Documentation](docs/AUTO_REVIEW_MERGE.md).

### Quick Start

The workflow runs automatically on:
- PR creation
- PR updates
- PR ready for review

No additional setup required! 🎉

## 👥 Auto-Assignment System

The Auto-Assignment System provides intelligent problem assignment and responsibility management:

1. **Intelligent Assignment** - Automatically analyzes problems and assigns to the most suitable team member
2. **Load Balancing** - Distributes work evenly across team members based on current workload
3. **SLA Monitoring** - Tracks response and resolution times with automatic escalation
4. **Performance Reporting** - Provides comprehensive analytics on team performance

For detailed information, see:
- [Auto-Assignment System Documentation](docs/AUTO_ASSIGNMENT_SYSTEM.md)
- [Auto-Assignment API Documentation](docs/AUTO_ASSIGNMENT_API.md)

### Quick Example

```bash
# Create an assignment
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/assignment/assign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "BACKEND_API",
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "description": "API endpoint error"
  }'
```

## 🆘 Advanced Escalation System

The Advanced Escalation System handles intelligent escalation when automated solutions fail, especially for safety-critical drone and autonomous vehicle scenarios:

1. **Multi-level Escalation** - 5-tier hierarchy from auto-fix to customer service
2. **Smart Agent Assignment** - Intelligent selection based on expertise, workload, and performance
3. **Safety-Critical Priority** - Immediate escalation for safety-related issues
4. **Complete Lifecycle** - Full tracking with detailed resolution records and statistics

**Escalation Levels:**
- **L1: Auto** - Automated processing and fixes
- **L2: Team Lead** - Team coordination and resource allocation
- **L3: Support Engineer** - Technical troubleshooting and investigation
- **L4: Senior Engineer** - Complex architectural and critical system issues
- **L5: Customer Service** - Safety-critical, high-impact customer issues

For detailed information, see:
- [Advanced Escalation System Documentation](docs/ADVANCED_ESCALATION_SYSTEM.md)
- [Advanced Features Summary](docs/ADVANCED_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md)

### Quick Example

```bash
# Create an escalation for auto-fix failure
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/escalation/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "incidentId": "incident-001",
    "trigger": "AUTO_FIX_FAILED",
    "priority": "CRITICAL",
    "context": {
      "systemType": "DRONE",
      "environment": "PRODUCTION",
      "errorDetails": {
        "message": "Flight controller auto-fix failed after 3 attempts",
        "affectedComponents": ["flight-controller"],
        "impactLevel": "HIGH"
      },
      "autoFixAttempts": []
    }
  }'
```

## 🏗️ Autonomous System Framework

The autonomous system framework provides a complete five-skeleton architecture for drone and self-driving vehicle development:

### Five-Skeleton Architecture

1. **Architecture Stability Skeleton** - C++ + ROS 2
   - Real-time flight control (100Hz control loop)
   - IMU sensor fusion
   - PID controller implementation

2. **API Governance Skeleton** - Python
   - Module responsibility matrix
   - API contract validation
   - Dependency chain verification

3. **Testing & Compatibility Skeleton** - Python + YAML
   - Automated test suites
   - Cross-version compatibility testing
   - Test report generation

4. **Security & Observability Skeleton** - Go
   - Distributed event logging
   - Safety monitoring and violation detection
   - Trace ID for distributed tracing

5. **Documentation & Examples Skeleton** - YAML + Markdown
   - Governance matrix definitions
   - Complete API documentation
   - Quickstart guides

### Quick Example

```bash
# Run API governance validation
cd automation/autonomous/api-governance
python3 api_contract.py

# Run compatibility tests
cd ../testing-compatibility
python3 test_compatibility.py

# Build and run flight controller (requires ROS 2)
cd ../architecture-stability
colcon build --symlink-install
ros2 run autonomy_core flight_controller
```

## 🤖 Dynamic Interactive CI System

We have implemented a **new dynamic interactive CI system** that turns every CI workflow into a flexible interactive customer service agent.

### 🎯 System Features

#### 1. Each CI is an Independent Interactive Service Agent
- 🤖 **Smart Agents**: Each CI (Core Services CI, Integration & Deployment, etc.) has its own interactive service agent
- 💬 **Independent Comments**: Each CI has independent comments and status reports in PRs
- 🎯 **Targeted Diagnostics**: Provides specialized error analysis and fix suggestions based on CI type
- 🏷️ **Precise Labels**: Each CI manages its own failure labels

#### 2. Unified Monitoring and Interaction
- 🔍 **Global Monitoring**: Dynamic CI assistant monitors the overall status of all CIs
- 🗣️ **Developer Interaction**: Supports `@copilot` commands for help
- 📊 **Unified Reporting**: Overall health reports across CIs
- ♻️ **Zero Resource Waste**: No repeated test runs, only intelligent analysis

### Usage

#### When CI Fails

1. **View Each CI's Independent Service Agent Comments**
   - Each CI (e.g., Core Services CI) has its own diagnostic report
   - Reports include CI-specific error analysis and fix suggestions
   - View the global monitoring assistant's overall analysis

2. **Execute CI-Specific Quick Fix Commands**
   Each CI's comments provide targeted fix commands, for example:
   ```bash
   # Core Services CI related
   npm test
   npm run lint:fix
   
   # Docker related CI
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker system prune -a
   
   # Environment check
   bash scripts/check-env.sh
   ```

3. **Interact with CI Service Agent for Help**
   Enter commands in PR comments for specific CIs:
   - `@copilot analyze Core Services CI` - Deep analysis of that CI
   - `@copilot fix Core Services CI` - Get auto-fix suggestions
   - `@copilot help Integration & Deployment` - View CI documentation
   - `@copilot similar Code Quality Check` - Find similar issues

### System Architecture

```
Each CI Workflow              Global Monitoring
─────────────────             ─────────────────
Core Services CI    ────┐
  └─ Interactive Agent    │
                          │
Integration CI      ────┤     Dynamic CI Assistant
  └─ Interactive Agent    ├───→ • Overall Status Monitoring
                          │     • Cross-CI Analysis
Deploy CI           ────┤     • Global Interaction
  └─ Interactive Agent    │
                          │
Code Quality CI     ────┘
  └─ Interactive Agent
```

### System Advantages

| Feature | Traditional CI | New System |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| **CI Independence** | Each CI runs independently | Each CI has its own interactive service agent |
| **Feedback Speed** | Need to check logs after failure | Get intelligent diagnosis in 30-60 seconds |
| **Diagnostic Quality** | Basic logs | AI-targeted analysis + fix suggestions |
| **Interactivity** | None | Each CI supports independent conversations |
| **Resource Consumption** | Normal CI execution | Additional service agent only 30-60 seconds |
| **Label Management** | Manual | Each CI automatically manages labels |
